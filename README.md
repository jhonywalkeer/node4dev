In this course, master Rodrigo Manguinho demonstrates in practice how to create an API in NodeJs using Typescript, MongoDB and following the best methodologies on the market. If you are tired of basic courses and really want to learn about advanced and relevant content like: Design Patterns, Clean Architecture, SOLID, DDD and TDD, this is the right content. The main objective of this training is to get you out of your comfort zone and see that there are many things to be studied to become a technical leader or a software architect. In addition to all this, it is shown in practice how to use Git, Docker, Jest, CI/CD, Swagger in the correct way and how to keep our code always clean, organized and well structured, including creating locks to prevent defective codes or badly formatted files are committed to our repository.

Let's talk about the correct use of middleware for managing permissions in routes and security in generating passwords, go deeper into the correct use of Test Driven Development, Clean Architecture, Clean Code, Design Patterns, Object Oriented Programming, SOLID Principles, showing more examples and covering several topics by students that were not covered, how to use frameworks like TypeORM in Clean Architecture correctly, how to integrate with third-party APIs using the most advanced features of Typescript and other ways to use TDD, with tools that help create mocks.
